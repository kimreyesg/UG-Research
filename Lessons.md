In semiconductor heterostructures, conduction and valence band edge profiles define quantum wells that selectively confine carriers. A lower conduction band edge in a layer (e.g. Semiconductor 1) forms a potential well for electrons, yielding quantized subbands and in-plane dispersions. Conversely, a higher valence band edge in that layer forms a potential well for holes, because holes energetically prefer regions where the valence band maximum is elevated, representing lower potential energy from the hole perspective. Thus, although the band edge diagrams may have identical shapes, conduction band wells confine electrons, while valence band wells confine holes, reflecting that electrons minimize their total energy by moving to lower band edges, while holes minimize theirs by moving to higher valence band edges.

# Important here: Valence band edge profile confines holes, conduction band edge profile confines electrons.

What if:
‚úÖ If the valence band edge in the middle layer is lower in energy, electrons could indeed prefer that region‚Äîbut normally, the valence band is full, so no electrons can move there without creating holes.

üö´ Thus, you can‚Äôt trap ‚Äúextra‚Äù electrons in a valence band well unless the band is partially empty‚Äîi.e. unless the material is metallic or heavily doped p-type with significant holes.

So:

Semiconductor valence band ‚Üí full ‚Üí no space for electrons to localize.

Metallic or degenerate semiconductor ‚Üí partially empty valence band ‚Üí possible to localize electrons.

But this is not typical in standard semiconductors.
