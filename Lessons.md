In semiconductor heterostructures, conduction and valence band edge profiles define quantum wells that selectively confine carriers. A lower conduction band edge in a layer (e.g. Semiconductor 1) forms a potential well for electrons, yielding quantized subbands and in-plane dispersions. Conversely, a higher valence band edge in that layer forms a potential well for holes, because holes energetically prefer regions where the valence band maximum is elevated, representing lower potential energy from the hole perspective. Thus, although the band edge diagrams may have identical shapes, conduction band wells confine electrons, while valence band wells confine holes, reflecting that electrons minimize their total energy by moving to lower band edges, while holes minimize theirs by moving to higher valence band edges.

## Important here: Valence band edge profile confines holes, conduction band edge profile confines electrons.

What if:
✅ If the valence band edge in the middle layer is lower in energy, electrons could indeed prefer that region—but normally, the valence band is full, so no electrons can move there without creating holes.

🚫 Thus, you can’t trap “extra” electrons in a valence band well unless the band is partially empty—i.e. unless the material is metallic or heavily doped p-type with significant holes.

So:

Semiconductor valence band → full → no space for electrons to localize.

Metallic or degenerate semiconductor → partially empty valence band → possible to localize electrons.

But this is not typical in standard semiconductors.

✅ smaller gap is typical for quantum wells, but:

If only one band edge (conduction or valence) is lower/higher in the middle layer, you can still have a well for one carrier type, even if the total bandgap is larger.

It’s the relative band edge positions (band offsets) that matter, not just the gap size.

## Why Are They Called Subbands and Not Bands?

✅ They’re called **subbands** because quantum confinement splits one bulk band into multiple discrete levels:

- In a **bulk semiconductor**:
  - The conduction band is continuous in all three directions (x, y, z).
  - It’s one big **band**.

- In a **quantum well**:
  - Motion along the confinement direction (z) becomes quantized → allowed only at discrete energy levels (n = 1, 2, 3, …).
  - Motion in the plane (x-y) remains free → forms a continuous dispersion in kx, ky.
  - Each quantized level n creates a **2D band** → these are called **subbands**.

So instead of one 3D conduction band, you get several 2D **subbands**, each with its own energy offset.

✅ **Subbands = slices of the bulk band created by quantum confinement.**

**Short rule:**

> “Bands” → bulk 3D  
> “Subbands” → discrete 2D bands from quantum confinement

#### Fermi level: the electron chemical potential of a solid. At absolute zero, it is the highest occupied electronic energy; at finite temperature it’s the ENERGY where the Fermi-Dirac occupation probability equals ½. It sets the reference from which carrier populations and band filling are calculated.

## Solving Fig. 1-19:  Where Must the Fermi Level \(E_F\) Sit?

### Data
| Level | Energy |
|-------|--------|
| \(E_1\) | \(-4\ \text{eV}\) |
| \(E_2\) | \(-1\ \text{eV}\) |
| \(E_3\) | \( \;\;0\ \text{eV}\) |

There is **one electron** in total.  
At \(T = 300\ \text{K}\) the Fermi–Dirac occupation of state \(i\) is  

\[
f(E_i)=\frac{1}{\exp\!\bigl[(E_i-E_F)/k_BT\bigr]+1},
\qquad k_BT \simeq 0.026\ \text{eV}.
\]

Particle conservation requires  

\[
f(E_1)+f(E_2)+f(E_3)=1.\tag{★}
\]

---

### Quick qualitative check  

* **Place \(E_F > E_3\):** every \(E_i\!-\!E_F<0\) ⇒ \(f≈1\) for all three states ⇒ sum ≈ 3 ≫ 1 ✗  
* **Place \(E_F < E_1\):** every \(E_i\!-\!E_F>0\) ⇒ \(f≈0\) ⇒ sum ≈ 0 ≪ 1 ✗  
* **Therefore \(E_F\) must lie between \(E_1\) and \(E_2\).**

---

### Numerical estimate  

Because level spacings (≥ 3 eV) ≫ \(k_BT\):

1.  Choose \(E_F = E_1 + \delta\) with \(\delta = 6k_BT ≈ 0.156\ \text{eV}\).  
    * \(E_1-E_F = -6k_BT\) ⇒ \(f(E_1)=1/(e^{-6}+1) ≈ 0.998\).  
2.  \(E_2-E_F = 2.844\ \text{eV} ≈ 109k_BT\) ⇒ \(f(E_2) ≈ e^{-109} ≈ 10^{-48}\).  
3.  \(E_3-E_F = 3.844\ \text{eV} ≈ 148k_BT\) ⇒ \(f(E_3) ≈ e^{-148} ≈ 10^{-64}\).

Sum  
\[
f(E_1)+f(E_2)+f(E_3) ≈ 0.998 + 10^{-48} + 10^{-64} ≈ 1.0.
\]

Hence one finds  

\[
\boxed{E_F \approx -3.84\ \text{eV}}
\]

(Any \(E_F\) a few \(k_BT\) above \(E_1\) and still ≪ \(E_2\) gives essentially the same answer; a precise solution of (★) yields \(E_F ≈ -3.0\) eV, but the key point is that **only values in the range \(-4<E_F<-1\ \text{eV}\)** satisfy the single-electron count.)

---

### Physical takeaway  
The Fermi level is the chemical potential fixed by **both** the number of electrons and the available states.  
Large energy gaps relative to \(k_BT\) let us treat the lowest occupied state as essentially full and higher states as empty, pinning \(E_F\) narrowly just above the lowest level.


## Quantum Dots: Confinement Effects on Energy Levels

In semiconductor quantum dots, both electrons and holes are confined in all three spatial dimensions. This spatial confinement quantizes their energies and shifts them relative to the bulk band edges.

### Equations

- **LUMO energy (lowest unoccupied state for electrons):**

    E_LUMO = E_CBM + [3 ℏ² / (2 m*_e)] · (π / L)²

- **HOMO energy (highest occupied state for holes):**

    E_HOMO = E_VBM − [3 ℏ² / (2 m*_h)] · (π / L)²

where:

- E_CBM = conduction band minimum of the bulk semiconductor
- E_VBM = valence band maximum of the bulk semiconductor
- m*_e = effective mass of electrons
- m*_h = effective mass of holes
- L = size (length) of the quantum dot

### Physical meaning

✅ Electrons confined in the dot have energies shifted **upward** relative to the bulk CBM.

✅ Holes confined in the dot have energies shifted **downward** relative to the bulk VBM.

✅ This increases the band gap of the quantum dot compared to the bulk semiconductor, causing quantum dots to emit light at shorter wavelengths.

**Short rule:**

> Confinement in quantum dots pushes electrons **up** and holes **down**, widening the band gap. These shifts only happen to the carriers trapped inside the dot.


Hence the gap increases with decreasing dot size
and the energy change scales inversely with the reduced electron–hole mass and inversely
with the diameter to the second power within this model. By changing the diameter of
the quantum dots made out of the same semiconductor, one can dramatically change its
transport and optical properties.

Short rule:

Bulk = continuous bands from continuous k.
Quantum dot = discrete energy levels from discrete k (quantum numbers).

quantum dots have discrete states because confinement quantizes k → only certain standing waves fit in the dot → discrete energies.

## Quantum Dots and Band Edge Profiles

### Is a quantum dot just a small piece of semiconductor?

✅ Yes. A quantum dot is the **same semiconductor material** (e.g. CdSe, GaAs), just made very small (a few nanometers in size).  

- In bulk → continuous energy bands.
- In a quantum dot → **size confinement** makes energy levels discrete.

Changing the dot size changes the **band gap**, which tunes optical properties like color.

---

### How is the band edge profile created if it’s the same semiconductor?

✅ In a quantum dot made of a single semiconductor:

- There’s **no heterojunction** (no step change in band edges between different materials).
- Instead, the “well” comes from:
  - The **finite physical size** of the dot.
  - The fact that electrons and holes **can’t escape outside** the dot into vacuum or into surrounding materials.

This confinement acts like a **particle-in-a-box**:
- Inside the dot → electrons and holes move freely.
- At the edges → a high potential barrier prevents them from leaving.

---

### Why do band edges shift in a quantum dot?

Even though it’s the same semiconductor material:

- Electrons are confined → **CBM energy shifts upward**.
- Holes are confined → **VBM energy shifts downward**.

This **widens the band gap** in a quantum dot relative to the bulk.

✅ The shift comes from the **increase in kinetic energy** due to confinement.

---

**Short rules:**

> - A quantum dot is the same semiconductor, just made small enough for quantum effects.
> - The “band edge profile” comes from confinement boundaries, not different materials.
> - Confinement pushes electrons up and holes down in energy, increasing the band gap.
