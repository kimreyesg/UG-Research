✅ **In tight-binding models (like graphene):**

- We build Bloch functions from **localized atomic orbitals** (e.g. pz in Graphene or h-BN).

- So the Bloch wave is:

    Psi_k(r) = sum over atoms [ exp(i * k ⋅ R) × (atomic orbital) ]

These are sometimes called **“tight-binding Bloch functions.”**

---

✅ there are **many ways to construct Bloch functions.**

- **Plane waves** → a common basis in DFT. Bloch waves can be built as:

    Psi_k(r) = sum over G [ c_G * exp(i * (k + G) ⋅ r) ]

→ purely delocalized building blocks.

---

✅ **Any basis can be used:**

- atomic orbitals → localized basis
- plane waves → delocalized basis
- Wannier functions → localized, orthogonal
- Gaussian-type orbitals → common in quantum chemistry

All of these can **generate Bloch waves** that satisfy:

    Psi_k(r + R) = exp(i * k ⋅ R) * Psi_k(r)

So **Bloch’s theorem** is universal—it doesn’t depend on which building blocks you choose.
